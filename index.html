  <h3>White Bread</h3>
  <div class="image-container">
<img src="./resources/images/bread.jpg" />
<h3 class="Ingredients"> Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>11 cups of flour</li>
  <li>2 t. of yeast</li>
  <li>6 t. sugar</li>
  <li>6 t. oil</li>
  <li>4 t. salt</li>
  <li>1 c. milk</li>
  <li>3 c. water</li>
  <li>Equipment:kettle, large mixing bowl, large mixing spoon(wooden), 4 cup glass measuring cup, plastic wrap, dish towel,baking sheet</li>

</ul>
<h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li> Put water in a kettle and turn on to heat up.</li>
<li>Put 4 cups of flour and all dry Ingredients into a very large bowl and stir to combine.</li>
<li>Pour oil and milk into large glass measuring cup. If you dont have a large measuring cup, combine Ingredients</li>
<li>start adding the hot water. When you have about a half cup of water left feel water and keep stirring and feeling the mixxed liquids as you add the water. If its to hot, add a little cold water
  . If its too cold, add more of the hot water it should be hot enough that you should feel a reaction to sticking in your finger, but not not enough that you want to pull your finger out</li>
<li>mix the liquids into the flour with a large spoon </li>
<li>pour remaining flour into the bowl, stirring as you go along. When its too hard to stir, add flour onto your spoon and scrap it clean. Start kneading</li>
<li>stop adding flour or add more flour to get a consistency where its no longer sticking to your fingers</li>
<li> Knead about ten minutes. You cant overknead when you are doing it by hand. You lift the bread onto its end, press down, turn the bowl, and repeat.</li>
<li>Stop when its satiny and it springs back right awat when you press on it.</li>
<li>Pour oil around the edge of the bowl. Spin the dough around inthe oil to cover the dough and the bowl with oil.</li>
<li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and then a towel.<li>
<li>if you are in a hurry, put it in a warm place.</li>
<li>After it has doubled in size, punch it down and form it how youd like to cook ot loaf, bread sticks,rolls,etc.</li>
<li>Let it rise another 40 minutes before baking at 400 degree in the oven for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Take it out an dget it out of the pan onto a cooling rack. Finished bread sounds hollow when you knock on the bottom.</li>
